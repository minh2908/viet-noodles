# Image Classification Project: 11 Types of Vietnamese Noodles

In this project, we build a classification model using a Residual Neural Network (ResNet). The model aims to discriminate pictures about 11 popular types of Vietnamese noodles. Those are bún chả-bún nem- bún thịt nướng, bún đậu, bún ngan, bún ốc, bún riêu, bún thang, miến lươn, phở bò, phở cuốn, phở gà, phở xào. Despite their popularity, these noodles look very similar that many foreigners found it hard to tell them apart. Motivated by this observation, the project aims to assist travellers in recognizing which kind of noodles they are eating. 

The dataset used in this project contains over 5,000 images collected via Google Images. The data was cleaned manually before training. The dataset is available on request, please send an email to minhdn24@gmail.com
